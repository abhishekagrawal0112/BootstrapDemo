        <p>Bootstrap 4 involves a major overhaul of Bootstrap with some big changes to the way it functions when compared to Bootstrap 3. There have been a lot of changes to most components, including tables, forms, grids, dropdowns, navbars, and more. Bootstrap 4 alpha was released on 19 August 2015. After two years in various alpha releases, Bootstrap 4 progressed to beta release in August 2017, then to beta 2 in October 2017, and then finally to the full V4 release in January 2018.</p>
